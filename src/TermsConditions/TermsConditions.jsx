          <strong>5.1. Paid Subscription Plans. </strong>Nethermind offers
          additional functionalities, access to which requires you to subscribe

            https://restaking.info/subscriptions

          . The subscription plans follow either a monthly or annua
          <strong>l</strong> billing period, please refer to the pricing page to

        <p>
          <strong>5.2. Stripe Integration</strong>. All fees payments are
          collected using the Stripe integration . By making the first
          subscription payment, you agree for Stripe to store the payment data
          and use it to charge you automatically upon the renewal of each
          relevant billing period.{' '}
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5.3. Payments. </strong>For the Services which entail a paid
          subscription plan, we calculate and bill fees according to the paid
          plan you subscribe to. For such Services, on the first day of each
          successive billing period, you will be automatically charged the
          applicable fees (the “<strong>Base Fees</strong>”) based on the
          Services in the relevant paid plan. All payments are non-refundable
          and neither Party will have the right to set off, discount, or
          otherwise reduce or refuse to pay any undisputed amounts due to the
          other Party under this Agreement.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, where the Licensed Volume has been exceeded in a given
          billing period, the overage fees shall be charged alongside the Base
          Fee on the first day of the following billing period, in accordance
          with section 6.3. below.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you make any other changes to the Services during a billing period
          (for example, upgrading or downgrading your paid subscription plan),
          we will apply any additional fees or credits to the next billing
          period.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5.4. Payment failure. </strong>If you fail to make any payment
          when due, (i) Nethermind reserves the right to charge late fees at
          1.5% per month or, if lower, the highest rate permitted by applicable
          law, and (ii) Nethermind may, in its discretion, suspend your access
          to the Services in accordance with section 6.1. of this Agreement. You
          will reimburse Nethermind for all reasonable costs and expenses
          incurred (including reasonable attorneys&#39; fees) in collecting any
          late payments or interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5.5. Taxes. </strong>You are responsible for all sales, use,
          ad valorem and excise taxes, value added, and any other similar taxes,
          duties, and charges of any kind imposed by any federal, state,
          multinational, or local governmental regulatory authority on any
          amount payable by you to Nethermind hereunder, other than any taxes
          imposed on Nethermind&#39;s income. In the event that you are required
          to deduct or withhold any taxes from the amounts payable to Nethermind
          hereunder, you will pay an additional amount, so that Nethermind
          receives the amounts due to it in full, as if there were no
          withholding or deduction.

          We collect and use the Personal Data about you for the purposes
          described above, because we have a legitimate business interest to do
          so that is not overridden by your right to have your Personal Data
          adequately protected. You do not have to provide us with any of the
          Personal Data described above, but if you choose not to do so, you may
          not be able to receive certain Services, access certain parts of our
          Site or receive information from us that you have requested.
        </p>

          <strong>5.5. Change of Purpose</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we
          collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for
          another reason and that reason is compatible with the original
          purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing
          for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please
          contact us.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          If we need to use your Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will
          notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do
          so.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Please note that we may process your Personal Data without your
          knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this
          is required or permitted by law.

          <strong>5.6. Data Aggregation</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We may collect, use and share Aggregated Data. Aggregated Data could
          be derived from your Personal Data, but it is not considered Personal
          Data under the UK GDPR on the basis that it does not directly or
          indirectly reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate your
          Usage Data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific
          feature of the Site or Services. Nethermind may also share this
          anonymous data with third-parties.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          For the avoidance of doubt, if the Aggregated Data can directly or
          indirectly identify you, the Company treats the data as Personal Data
          which will be used in accordance with this Policy.

          Data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our

          Nethermind may be required to transfer Personal Data to a
          country/countries around the world including countries in Europe, US,
          Asia, Africa. If we transfer your Personal Data out of the UK, we
          ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at
          least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>
            The country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of

            If we use certain service providers based outside the UK, we may use

            same protection it has in the UK.

        <ul>
          <li style={{ listStyleType: 'disc' }}>

          unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access

          other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
          process your Personal Data on our instructions and they are subject to
          a duty of confidentiality.

          We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal

          <strong>7.2. Data Retention</strong>

        <p>
          We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as reasonably
          necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for. We may retain
          your Personal Data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or
          if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation in respect
          to our relationship with you.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          To determine the appropriate retention period for Personal Data, we
          consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the
          potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
          Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data
          and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the

          time, by contacting us. Where you opt out of receiving these marketing

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy should tell you everything you need to know, but
          you can always contact us to ask any questions or if you wish to
          exercise any of your rights in relation to your Personal Data, using
          the contact information below:{' '}

        <p>
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your Personal Data (or to
          exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
          fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
          Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us
          confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your Personal
          Data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security
          measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person
          who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for
          further information in relation to your request to speed up our
          response.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 28 working days.
          Occasionally it could take us longer, if your request is particularly
          complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will
          notify you and keep you updated.
        </p>

          You have the right to make a complaint to the supervisory authority if
          you are unhappy with how we’ve handled your Personal Data. In the UK,
          the supervisory authority is the Information Commissioner’s Office
          (http://www.ico.org.uk).
